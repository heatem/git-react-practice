## Purpose

This is an overly complicated git cheat sheet project, created to provide react practice while turning my git cheat sheet into a webpage.

## Getting started

1. Fork this project
2. Click “Clone or download” button and copy the link
3. Using command line (ex. Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows), change to the directory where you want to save (for example, if you want to save to desktop: ```cd Desktop```)
4. Clone the project: git clone {paste link from step 2 here} (ex. ```git clone https://github.com/heatem/git-react-practice.git```)
5. Change into the project folder (```cd git-react-practice```)
6. Check for NPM: ```npm -v``` (to confirm npm is installed. If not, check this out treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html)
7. Install Gatsby: ```npm install -g gatsby-cli``` (might need to do ```sudo npm install -g gatsby-cli```)
8. Run ```npm install```
9. Run ```npm start``` to start your local server
10. In your browser (ex. Chrome, Firefox), go to localhost:8000 to see your site

## Continuing work
1. Using command line, cd into the project folder and run ```gatsby develop``` to start your local server
2. Edit your code in your IDE/text editor of choice (ex. Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
3. In your browser, go to localhost:8000 to see your site

Open the project in your text editor/IDE (ex. VS Code). I have put some git commands in the index.js file (path: git-react-practice/src/pages/index.js).
- **Task 1:** Create a components folder
- **Task 2:** Create a header component for the title of the page and replace the h3 in the index.js file with the component
- **Task 3:** Create component(s) for each section of the cheat sheet in the way you see fit, then replace the html with the components in index.js
- **Bonus:** Style any/all components
